# run observable prerender

Proof of concept showing how to run [observable-prerender](https://github.com/asg017/observable-prerender) with Github Actions.

You can use both [node.js](.github/ca_maps.js) and [bash scripts](.github/air-quality.sh) as inputs to your [workflow](.github/workflows/) files.

The benefit of this setup is that you can trigger these workflows programmatically or on a schedule. Furthermore, you can commit the screenshot outputs back to the report.
